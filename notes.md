# Notes

  * Change all NSLog and format specifier stuff to Swift standard interpolation
  * Also this should include some basic information on debugging
  * Have them print out various things, show them (with screenshots) how to put in a breakpoint
  * Show that the prints after the break point aren't printed yet because execution is stopped
  * So them basic commands in the lldb. Remember they don't know variables or functions yet. Just show them running print statements or basic math
